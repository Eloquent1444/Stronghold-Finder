# Stronghold-Finder
Python app that let's you search for strongholds easily. There's a feature to try and look for strongholds with only one eye but it rarely works.
On the other hand, the two eye throw triangulation method works perfectly and pinpoints exactly the location of the stronghold
There is a 1.19 mode togglelable option to increasing one eye finding's performance

How to use:
Throw an eye of ender
Put your crosshair exactly in it's middle
Don't move and open f3
open the chat to prevent you from accidently moving your mouse or keyboard
Load the app and fill in the coordinates. You should be able to find the angle in the f3 menu on the line that says "facing:"
On the end of that line you should see two numbers separated by a "/"
Type the first number in the angle prompt

To use one eye stronghold finding, check if the checkbox is in a correct state.
It should be checked if you're on 1.19 or above and unchecked if you aren't
If you're very far away from x=0, y=0 (Multiple thousands of blocks) you can check the range that the program will look in.

Now if you want to use two eyes stronghold finding (strongly advised) move to about 80 blocks from where you were standing and walk  in a direction that is perpendicular
to the path of the eye you just threw. (Just walk to your right or left lmao)

Redo the process but this time fill in the second cases.
Press start and voila! Time to beat the dragon.
